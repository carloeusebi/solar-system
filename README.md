Hello! This is project I made to learn CSS animation for the first time, while my course class was still learning Flexbox.<br>
Later I used this same project while learning Javascript. Code is very ugly but I decided to let it that way to show my thought process while learning JS.

Later when I feel more confident I may decide to make a new version with a nice written code!
